I am a Master's in Science in Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in 
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Real time/Embedded systems</li>
<li>Computer Networks</li>
<li>Data science/Machine learning</li> 
<!--neuroscience/control systems-->

<br>
I was previously the on board computer subsystem lead for <a href="https://projecteinsat.wordpress.com/">Project EINSat</a>, where I lead a team of students passionate about building software and hardware for our cubesat mission.

I have experience working in the os internals of the xv6 teaching operating system, thanks to a bootcamp I have participated in offered by IIT Bombay.

I enjoy collaborative storytelling, and when I'm not working you can find me crafting adventures and creating characters. Reading, especially scifi and fantasy is one of my hobbies. The technological future fascinates me and I would love to be an influence in it through my work.
