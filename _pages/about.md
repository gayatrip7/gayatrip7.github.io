I am a final year undergraduate computer science student at <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/">BITS Goa</a>. I am interested in 
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Real time/Embedded systems</li>
<li>Data science/Machine learning</li> 
<!--neuroscience/control systems-->

<br>
I am the on board computer subsystem lead for <a href="https://projecteinsat.wordpress.com/">Project EINSat</a>, where I lead a team of students passionate about building software and hardware for our cubesat mission.

I love table top roleplaying games, and when I'm not working you can find me crafting adventures and creating characters. I love reading, especially scifi and fantasy. The technological future fascinates me and I would love to be an influence in it through my work.
