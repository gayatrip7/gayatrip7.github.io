I am a Master's in Science in Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in 
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Real time/Embedded systems</li>
<li>Computer Networks</li>
<li>Data science/Machine learning</li> 

<br>
I was previously the on board computer subsystem lead for <a href="https://projecteinsat.wordpress.com/">Project EINSat</a>, where I lead a team of students passionate about building software and hardware for our cubesat mission. I went on to do my <a href="https://github.com/gayatrip7/einsat-mcs">undergraduate thesis</a> in mixed criticality systems and functional safety for this project. 

I have experience working in the os internals of the xv6 teaching operating system, thanks to a bootcamp I have participated in offered by IIT Bombay.

I enjoy collaborative storytelling, and when I'm not working, you can find me crafting adventures. Reading, especially scifi and fantasy, is one of my hobbies. The technological future excites me and I would love to be an influence on it through my work.
